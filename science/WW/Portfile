description         A command line tool to disaggregate Scantron or ZipGrade pre- and post-test responses into Walstad and Wagner learning types (Walstad and Wagner 2016) and adjusts them for guessing (Smith and Wagner 2017).

long_description    In the Spring of 2016, Walstad and Wagner released a paper suggesting that the pretest/posttest delta is insufficient in assessing learning outcomes. However, performing such a disaggregation is time intensive, especially if the questions appear in a different location (or order) on the pre and post test.  WW_out is a command line tool that makes this disaggregation easy. It uses four CSV files to generate outcomes by question and student.
